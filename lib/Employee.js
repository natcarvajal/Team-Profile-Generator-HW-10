// The application must include Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern classes. The tests for these classes (in the _tests_ directory) must ALL pass.
// The first class is an Employee parent class with the following properties and methods:
// name
// id
// email
// getName()
// getId()
// getEmail()
// getRole()â€”returns 'Employee'
// The other three classes will extend Employee.
